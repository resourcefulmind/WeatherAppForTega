## A Weather App For Tega

This app is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the basic functionalities.

AJAX will be used to handle the API requests and OpenWeatherMap is the preferred weather API of choice as it is free and provides reliable historical, current and forecasted weather data via light-speed APIs..

Special appreciation goes to George Martsoukos whose detailed tutorials provided a solid background towards building this project.
